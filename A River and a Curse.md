**I am the Wheel that never rusts.**  
**I am the maw that swallows stars, and the womb that spits them out again.**  
**I am Kaal.**

**Mortals are obsessed with lines. They trace their lives from the sunrise to the sunset, from birth to death. They are fools. They are ants stumbling along the rim of a potter’s wheel, convinced they are traversing the world when they are merely spinning in the dark.**

**I know where this leads. I have seen this war before. I have tasted this specific vintage of blood a thousand times.**

**I do not measure existence in the flickering heartbeat of years, but in Yugas—the great, grinding turns of the Wheel.**

**In the Satya Yuga, the Age of Truth, the Bull of Dharma stood unyielding on four legs. Purity and Sin were separated by the cold vacuum of galaxies; the Devas reigned in Swarga, the Asuras brooded in Patala. The war was fought between worlds.**

**Then the Wheel turned. In the Treta Yuga, the Age of Fire, the Bull balanced on three legs. The gap narrowed. Good and Evil were no longer separated by stars, but by a single ocean. Rama stood against Ravana. The war was fought between kingdoms.**

**Now, we stand in the twilight of the Dwapara Yuga, the Age of Doubt. The Bull trembles on two legs. The gap has vanished entirely. Good and Evil no longer inhabit different worlds, nor different nations. They share the same bloodline. They break bread at the same table. The war is no longer between strangers; it is between brothers.**

**And soon... the wheel will groan once more. The Kali Yuga comes. The Age of Darkness. When the battlefield shrinks to its final, claustrophobic limit. The war will retreat into the bone and marrow. It will be fought in the violent silence of your own skull.**

**You ask me of Dharma. You look for the line between the Saint and the Sinner.**  
**Look closer.**

**A spy is dragged from the brush on a kingdom’s border. He carries a cipher that will burn a capital city to ash, ending ten thousand lives. But the spy is a child, twelve years old, shaking in the grip of his captors, obeying a father he fears.**

**The General draws his blade. He looks into the boy’s weeping eyes.**  
**If he spares the child, he preserves his humanity, but he lets the city burn. His mercy becomes a slaughter.**  
**If he strikes the child down, he saves the city, but his soul is stained forever with innocent blood.**

**Tell me: When the steel falls, is it Dharma? Or is it Sin?**

**Do not look for heroes here. Do not look for villains.**  
**To the saved city, the General is a god. To the boy’s mother, he is a monster. Both are true. Truth is not a rock; it is a shattered mirror, reflecting a different face depending on where you stand.**

**And do not speak to me of Fairness. Speak only of Karma.**  
**Forget the judges. Forget the morality. Karma is simply the Echo. You scream into the canyon, and the sound returns. You strike the drum, and the skin vibrates. Gravity does not hate you when you fall; it simply pulls.**  
**So it is with Karma. It is the cold mathematics of consequence, indifferent to your prayers.**

**I have watched the Suras—your Gods. Beings of blinding light, yet drunk on the nectar of immortality. Their purity makes them arrogant. Their light blinds them to the suffering of the small.**  
**I have watched the Asuras—your Demons. Beings of shadow, yet possessed of a devotion that shames the pious. Their ambition is a fire that drives them to greatness.**

**Neither is whole. To exist is to be flawed. They are merely two sides of the same coin, spinning in the palm of the Brahman.**  
**The Formless One. The Silent Dreamer who imagines us all. The Infinite that remains even when you subtract the Infinite from it.**

**Every truth is a beam of light; every lie is the shadow it casts. Both belong to the Brahman. Neither ever left home.**

**But here, knee-deep in the churning mud of Kurukshetra, philosophy is a luxury. Perfection is a myth.**  
**Only the Choice remains.**

**We stand at the precipice. The Dwapara is dying. The sun sets gray and sickly on the era of heroes.**

**Listen.**  
**Do not listen for the screams; screams are common things, cheap and plentiful.**  
**Listen to the silence before the roar.**

The Sabha of Hastinapura was a cavern of gold and guilt. 

It was a masterpiece of architecture, a hall designed to amplify the voice of power, with pillars carved of marble and etched in patterns of beaten gold. But today, the hall was not a place of governance. It was a tomb.

Dhritarashtra’s shoulders filled the Lion Throne, his arms thick with muscles that had never known the fatigue of battle, only the atrophy of inaction. He was blind, but in this moment, his blindness was not a lack of sight; it was a heightened state of terror. 

He could hear the dust settling. 

He could hear the sputtering of the oil lamps, fueled by camphor and desperation. 

He could hear the shallow, ragged breathing of his wife, standing like a sentinel beside him.

"Sanjaya," the King whispered. His voice was gravel grinding on stone. "Speak."

At the foot of the throne sat Sanjaya—the king’s messenger, mud-streaked, breathless, and still shivering from what he had just witnessed. He crouched on a silk mat as though it were thorns, shoulders shivering with a fever no physician could name. His hands he kept folded under the fall of his cloak, hiding the dark crust of blood that refused to leave his palms. Hours ago, those same hands had carried a bundle so heavy it still ached in his bones.

He had not merely seen the war.  
He had walked through it.

Sanjaya wiped a line of sweat from his forehead. His eyes were open, bloodshot, staring at nothing and seeing everything.

"The count," Dhritarashtra demanded, his fingers digging into the velvet armrests of the throne. "Give me the count."

"The western flank held," Sanjaya recited, his voice monotone, detached, the voice of a man cataloging the end of the world. "Your son, Vikarna, lost three battalions. The elephants... the elephants panicked in the mud. Two hundred crushed by their own panic."

Dhritarashtra nodded. His face remained a mask of stone. These were numbers. Costs. In the ledger of war, soldiers were currency, and he was willing to spend them. "And Duryodhana?"

"He fights with the fury of a storm," Sanjaya said. "He took three wounds to the chest but refused to leave the field."

"Good. Good," Dhritarashtra muttered. "My son is iron."

Beside him, Gandhari shifted. The rustle of her silk sari sounded like a blade being drawn in the quiet hall. She did not sit. She had stood for days, or perhaps years. Her blindfold, a strip of white silk, a dam containing her. She did not care for the strategy. She was listening for the heartbeat of her lineage, and she found the rhythm failing.

"Is that all?" the King asked, sensing the hesitation in his narrator. "Sanjaya. Why do you stop?"

Sanjaya swallowed. The sound echoed in the vast, empty dome.

"Today, My King, The Thirteenth Day" Sanjaya whispered. "Acharya Drona unleashed the Chakravyuh."

Dhritarashtra froze. The Chakravyuh. The Spinning Wheel. It was not merely a formation; it was a grinder of flesh. A labyrinth of soldiers rotating in seven concentric circles, shifting like the tides, designed to suck an enemy into the center and crush them.

"It was perfect, My King," Sanjaya continued, his voice trembling as he re-lived the sight. "A blooming lotus of spears. Jayadratha held the gate. The Pandavas were cut off. Yudhishthira, Bhima, Nakula... they battered against the outer rim like moths against a storm. Only one breached it."

"Who?"

"The boy," Sanjaya said. He could not bring himself to say the rank. "Abhimanyu."

The name struck the King like a physical blow. Dhritarashtra flinched, his head jerking back. Abhimanyu. Arjuna’s son. Subhadra’s pride. Krishna’s nephew. A child. Sixteen summers old. A boy whose laughter Dhritarashtra remembered echoing in these very corridors before the dice game, before the exile.

For a moment, the King vanished, and the old uncle appeared. He saw the boy’s face in the darkness of his mind—curly hair, eyes like lotus petals, a smile that forgave everything.

"Dead?" Dhritarashtra asked. The word was a fragile thing.

"Butchered," Sanjaya corrected, his voice trembling with a sudden surge of grief. "He broke six circles, My King. He fought like a god. But the seventh... the seventh was a slaughterhouse. Six Maharathis. Drona. Karna. Ashwatthama. Kripa. Your son, Duryodhana. And Dushasana. They surrounded him. He was weaponless. His chariot was shattered. He picked up a wheel... a broken chariot wheel... and swung it like Vishnu’s disc. But arrows do not respect courage. They cut his bowstring. They killed his horses. And then... Dushasana beheaded him."

Gandhari let out a sound. It was not a scream. It was a sharp intake of breath, like a rib snapping. She brought a hand to her mouth, stifling the sob that threatened to tear her apart. She swayed, her hand gripping the edge of the throne.

She knew. In the dark behind her blindfold, she saw what her husband refused to see. The rules are dead. Dharma had fallen with that boy. If a child, unarmed, could be slaughtered by six veterans, then there was no code left. The war was no longer a battle for a throne; it was an annihilation. Her sons would not be spared now. No one would be spared.

Dhritarashtra slumped. The strength left his massive arms. He looked small on the great Lion Throne.

"He was a child," the King whispered, speaking to the ghosts in the room. "He used to call me Tat-shri. He sat on my lap." 

Then, a new terror seized him. A terror colder than the grave. 

"The mothers," Dhritarashtra rasped, grabbing Sanjaya’s shoulder with a desperate, crushing grip. "Sanjaya... where are the mothers? You tell them?"

"O my king... do not ask," his eyes whispered.

He squeezed them shut, but the darkness offered no relief. In the blackness behind his eyelids, the gold of the throne room dissolved. The scent of camphor and royal perfume was choked out by the phantom smell of damp earth and iron.

He was no longer kneeling on silk. He was back there. Back where he had stood three hours ago.
The memory seized him.
Here, in the lands that would one day be called Kurukshetra...

Here, in the lands that would one day be called **Kurukshetra**, the Holy Ganga still ruled the horizon with her sisters. The war was not a list of numbers; it was a physical weight hanging in the air. Evening mist clung to the riverbanks, turning everything into a gray purgatory. The Ganga flowed sluggishly, dark and opaque, as if already heavy with secrets and washed sins.

Three women were alone in the gloom.

Kunti sat on a jagged rock, her posture rigid. The mother of the Pandavas looked like she had been carved from the same granite she sat upon. Her hair, once black as a raven’s wing, was now streaked with iron gray. She stared at the water, unblinking. She had birthed this war. Every arrow fired was, in some way, birthed from her womb, from her choices, from her silence. She did not weep. Queens do not weep when the world is watching.

Standing near the water’s edge was Draupadi. The Fire-Born. The Empress. Tonight, she looked like a flame that had been doused. Her hair hung loose and wild, swaying in the damp wind. She was not crying; she was beyond tears. She was holding the woman in front of her, her hands gripping her shoulders with enough force to bruise, acting as an anchor to keep the other woman from drifting away.

And in the mud, on her knees, was Subhadra.

Subhadra, the sister of Krishna. Subhadra, the wife of Arjuna. 

She was unrecognizable. Her fine silks were stained with clay. Her jewelry was torn away. She was rocking back and forth, a low, rhythmic keen escaping her throat—a sound that was half-prayer, half-madness.

"He is late," Subhadra whispered to the mud. "He is just late. The wheel broke. He is fixing the wheel. He is good with machines. He is just fixing the wheel."

"Subhadra," Draupadi whispered, her voice cracking. "Look at me."

"No!" Subhadra snapped, jerking away. She scrambled up, slipping in the slush, her eyes wide and frantic. "Do not say it, Panchali. If you say it, you make it true. He is waiting for his father. Arjuna will bring him back. Krishna will bring him back. They are gods! Do you hear me? They are gods! They do not let children die!"

Kunti closed her eyes. A single tear escaped, tracing a path through the dust on her cheek. She knew the truth about gods. Gods demanded sacrifice. They did not prevent it.

A sound came from the mist. Footsteps. Heavy, dragging footsteps.

Emerging from the fog was Sanjaya, barefoot, breathless. He was not the projection of a divine sight now; he was a man of flesh and bone, covered in gray ash, his robes torn. 

He carried a bundle in his arms. It was small. Wrapped in a strip of deep red cloth—the kind worn at weddings, bright as a bride’s veil. But this red had darkened, its weight dragging down the folds, as though it carried a grief too heavy for fabric to bear.

Subhadra stopped breathing. The manic energy left her legs, and she stood frozen, swaying like a reed in a storm.

Sanjaya stopped five paces away. He fell to his knees. He bowed his head until his forehead touched the cold mud. "Forgive me."

"Where is he?" Subhadra whispered. Her voice was terrifyingly calm. "Sanjaya. Where is my son?"

Sanjaya did not lift his head. He lifted the bundle. He offered it up to the gray sky.

"The Chakravyuh was... thorough," Sanjaya said, the words tearing out of his throat. "The Kauravas... they did not leave much to find, Princess. The vultures... the jackals... the sky was hungry today."

Subhadra stared at the bundle. It was too small to be a body. It was too small to be a torso.

"Tell me it is a lie," she begged, stepping forward. "Tell me he is injured. Tell me this is his helmet."

Sanjaya said nothing.

Subhadra reached out. Her hands trembled so violently that she struggled to grasp the silk. She took the weight of it. It was heavy. Damp. 

She pulled the silk away.

It was not a helmet.

It was Abhimanyu. Or what remained of the beauty that was Abhimanyu. 

His head. 

The severance was clean. But the face... the face was untouched by the horror. His eyes were closed, his long lashes resting against his cheeks. There was a smear of dirt on his forehead, right where his mother used to kiss him. He looked like he was sleeping in her arms. He looked like he was dreaming of a world better than this one.

Draupadi gasped, turning her face away, unable to bear the sight. Kunti did not look away; she stared at her grandson’s severed head, and her heart turned to ash.

Subhadra did not scream. Not yet. 

She traced the line of his jaw with a muddy thumb. She brushed a lock of curly hair from his forehead. It was an intimate, tender moment, horrific in its grotesque isolation.

"You are cold," she whispered to the head. "Why are you so cold? I told you to wear your armor. I told you..."

Then, the reality punctured the shock.

The scream that tore out of her body was not human. It was the sound of a soul being ripped from its casing. It echoed across the river, silencing the distant war drums, silencing the wind, silencing the very flow of time.

She clutched the head to her chest, staining her own clothes with the seeping blood. She turned toward the river. 

"Subhadra! No!" Draupadi lunged, but she was too slow.

Subhadra waded into the Ganga. The water swirled around her waist, cold and indifferent. She held her son’s head up to the twilight sky, an offering to a heaven that was empty. 

She looked down at the dark, rushing water.

"You flow!" she shrieked at the river. "You flow on! You watched him born! You watched him play! And today you watched him die! From you only, it all began!"

The river gurgled against her thighs.

"You wash away the blood!" Subhadra screamed, her voice breaking into jagged shards of rage. "You cleanse the sins of men so they can sin again! I curse you, Ganga! I curse you!"

She slammed her hand into the water, shattering her own reflection.

"May you forget your own course!" she screamed. "May you wander the earth, lost like my son was lost! May you never flow clear again! Choke on our filth! Choke on our sins! May this soil never rinse off the blood! Turn red! Turn red and remember him!"

She collapsed. Her legs gave way, and she fell forward into the embrace of the river. The current caught her. She did not fight it. She floated, her sari billowing out like a bruised flower, clutching the head of her son as the gray water swallowed her grief.

**I heard her.**

**Kaal heard her.**

**And the earth listened.**

**The river would shift. Centuries later, men would look at maps and wonder why the great Saraswati dried up, why the Ganga writhed and changed her path, moving away from the ruins of kings.**

**The soil listened. Go to Kurukshetra today. Dig your fingers into the earth. It is not brown. It is red. Iron oxide, they say. Science, they say. But I know. The soil drank so much blood that it forgot how to be anything else.**

**The water listened. The curse held. The river that was once the nectar of gods is now a sewer of human neglect, thick with the ashes of the dead and the refuse of the living. She flows, but she is not clear. She flows, but she is heavy.**

**Subhadra drifted.**

**The current pulled her away from the shore, away from the fires of war, pulling her back into the mist.**

**Drifting.**

**Drifting back.**

**I made her drift back against the flow.**

**The gray water swirled, turning backward, unwinding the clock. The red of the blood diluted, fading into pink, then white, then a crystalline blue. The stench of death dissolved into the scent of jasmine.**

**The river flowed back to the mountains.**

**Back to the beginning.**

**Back to where the water was pure, and the only thing it carried was love. But ask yourselves: now that you know the cost of that love—now that you know the price is a mother’s sanity... would you still have let the journey begin? Is it a gift to give them life, or just a longer way to die?**
